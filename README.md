# Ncurses Text Editor (WIP)

**Status: In Progress**

A terminal-based text editor built in C++ using the `ncurses` library, inspired by **Vim**. Designed to be lightweight, modular, and efficientâ€”with tiling windows, multiple buffers, and Vim-like modal editing.

---

## Build

```sh
make
```

## Run

```sh
bin/main [<filename1> [<filename2>...]]
```

## Test

```sh
bin/test
```

---

## Features (In Progress)

- Tiling window management using a binary tree layout
- Tab and buffer management for multiple open files
- Vim-style modal editing: Insert, Normal, and Command modes
- Lazy redraw: only update modified parts of the screen
- Graceful terminal resizing
- Plugin-like file event handlers (e.g., `:Ex` to explore files)
- Chord-style keybindings for navigation and actions
- Modular and extensible architecture
